# flame_API
OpenAPI 3 definition for flame and django rest framework implementation.

## flame API design explanation
Here I'll use the base URL to be `api.flame.edu/v1/` as a placeholder for the future (no yet created) base URL that respects the consortium specs.

For sake of simplicity and guiven the architecture of flame this API uses 3 roots:

```
/manage
/build
/predict
```

Each model is a *resource* that the client can create, modify, delete or exploit so the url structure will be:

```
api.flame.edu/v1/{root}/models/{modelname}
```

Over this resource the client can create, delete and get info with the HTTP verbs (POST, DELETE, GET).
